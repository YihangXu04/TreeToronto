# Urban Tree Data Analysis for Toronto: Analyzing Tree Species Distribution and Diameters Across Wards

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for the paper titled "Analyzing Tree Species Distribution and Diameters Across Urban Toronto Wards". The study investigates the characteristics of Torontoâ€™s urban forest by examining tree species, diameters, and their distribution across different municipal wards.

The dataset provides detailed information about tree diameters, species (both scientific and common names), and the geographic locations of trees. The analysis focuses on understanding the structure of the urban forest, species dominance, tree size distribution, and potential disparities in tree distribution across Toronto's neighborhoods.



## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the AI chatgpt. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of Chatgpt and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
